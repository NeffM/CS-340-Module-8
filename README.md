How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?  

  
  
Using CRUD is important in any program. Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting structures can be used. In Java API we can use Puts, Get, Deletes, Options, Posts, and more. Learning CRUD programming teaches structure, and helps with testing and writing clean maintainable code. CRUD teaches consistency, separation, abstraction, and reusability skills that can be implemented in MySQL, PostgreSQL, or even NoSQL databases, and lastly as mentioned in RESTful APIs that interact with databases.   
  
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?  
  
Approaching problems like a scientist can be broken down into many steps. Analysis of code learning and understanding the requirements of their problem. Designing and planning. Testing to ensure good code quality and clients' needs. Documentation and not keeping for future maintainability and code comprehension. Approaching the assignment at first was difficult I chose to take the project as a whole. After breaking down the project into segments I was able to easily tackle all the needed tasks. There were a few complications and mistakes that caused major setbacks, however, it did not stop my persistence in passing the class and ensuring all the work was done and turned in.   
  
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do its work better?
Computer scientists design and develop software, algorithms, and systems to solve complex to easy problems. Computer scientists play a critical role in a data-driven world, making their work essential. Lastly, computer scientists posses great decision making, and present data in a safe user-friendly manner.
